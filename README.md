### How I read papers:
1. The 1st pass is just a quick read through the _Abstract_, _Introduction_ and _Conclusion_ and a cursory glance of _Figure 2_ and the results in the _Experiments_ section.
2. Moving on, the 2nd pass of the paper is to read each sentence intently, highlighting interesting sentences and making sure I understand what each paragraph tries to convey in a comprehensive manner.
3. Lastly, the 3rd pass is to write notes either on paper or digitally as if I'm presenting this paper to my friend / advisor so that they understand it easily without ever having to read the paper.

Paper's I've read with notes listed in no particular order below. Further, papers are numbered on a (1) to (5) scale where a (1) means I have only barely skimmed it, while a (5) means I feel confident that I understand almost everything about the paper.
